# Threejs Multivariable Calculus Visualizations MIT 2022

This is a showcase of math visualizations that were made during the years 2020-2022 at MIT. 

They were made by Duncan Levear and Jennifer French at MIT in 2020-2022 and included in online courses run during that time.

Others should feel inspired to adapt these for their own uses.

# Symbolic links to helper files

The visualizations are `.html` files. They all depend on a collection of helper `.js` files (including `three.min.js`). 

Because it made it easier to import the images to the online courses, we have written the `.html` files to expect the `.js` files to be in the same directory. For that reason, we include symbolic links to all `.js` files in the same directory as the `.html` files, with the oriinal `.js` files in the repo's root. 

Also, for an uninteresting technical reason, to use these in our online course, we needed to prepend `threejs_` to each symlink filename.
